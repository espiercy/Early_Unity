"You betrothed, Mina Mumoo has been taken by the BARON OF CASTLE BADMOUNT! After learning of the baron's vile deeds, you have tracked him to the fortress, CASTLE BADMOUNT, to rescue Mina."

What shoud you do now? You could run up to the front gate and try to find a way to bust in. Or, you could shout Mina's name with reckless regard for safety.

1. Charge at the front gate.
2. Scream Mina's name.
